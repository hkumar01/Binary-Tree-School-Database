Compile/Runtime Errors
- Operation 11 sometimes does not work during runtime 

References 
- Referenced former orientation leader Michelle Kutsanov code for structure and organization, implementation was done on my own, also used her BST treeToFile function to save masterStudent and masterFaculty to file
- Used thomas moore double linked list search and removeAtPos functions because my removeNode function was having issues (no longer using, but still in my linkedlist implementation)
- Reading comma separated text file http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/17771/ 
- Parsing comma separated string https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-parse-a-comma-separated-string-in-c/#:~:text=Get%20the%20substring%20if%20the,and%20stored%20in%20the%20vector 
- Professor German and TAâ€™s Josh and Wesley

Instructions to use program:
- g++ *.cpp
- ./a.out
- When running the database files in the program for a second time, first you have to remove the extra newline from both text files, save the file, then run the database again.
- Sample student and faculty textfiles have been provided to see the formatting of the files.
